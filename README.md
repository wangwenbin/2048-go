##about 2048-go
2048 is a famous game by Gabriele Cirulli, I copyed the idea and rewrite it with golang. 

This 2048 runs under terminial. It can run without X under linux. I don't know if it works under DOS, But it works under CMD. The code is cross platform for using golang. 

Thanks for termbox-go.

This is Gabriele Cirulli's code.
